# Northstar Ban List

Website for creating and managing a distributable ban list

## Setup

This is a very simple management platform that saves all UID's as a text file so not much is needed in the way of hosting except PHP with write access.

1. Download the repo
2. Rename the `/admin/password.php.example` to `/admin/password.php` and add your password.
3. Upload the files to a PHP server:

   - index.php
   - style.css
   - /admin/
   - /api/
